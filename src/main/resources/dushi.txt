While his servants were installing themselves and getting
things to rights, the gentleman had betaken himself to the
general parlour. Every traveller knows what these common
parlours are like: the same walls painted in oil colours,
darkened above by pipe-smoke, and covered below with the
marks made by the backs of travellers and tradespeople, for
merchants come here on market-days in sixes and sevens to
drink their customary two glasses of tea. There was the usual

as cabbage soup with tarts, purposely kept for several weeks,
calfs brain*, with peas, small sausages with cabbage, roast
capon, pickled cucumbers, and the eternal sweet puff-paste tarts
which are always ready at one's service â€” while he was being
served with all these either warm or cold, he made the waiter
